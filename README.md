# Dotacli

Welcome to my dotacli gem. Dota2 is a popular PC game. In this gem, you will be able to view a list of all of the games heroes and have the option of choosing a particular hero in that list to view some more information on the particular hero.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dotacli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dotacli

## Usage

Open your command prompt and type in the follow instructions:

 $ git clone dotacli
 $ bundle install
 $ rake install dotacli
 $ dotacli

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
